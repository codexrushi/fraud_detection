The project is about to detect the credit card fraud and compare the accuracy score and f1 score of all models and conclude the best model for this application.
# libraries used:
numpy, pandas, seaborn,matplotlib,statmodels,xgboost,scikitlearn,metrics.
# ML models to be compared 
decision tree,
KNN-nearest neighbour,
logistic regression,
SVM(support vector machine),
XGBOOST.
# conclusion
The model XGBOOST is best suited for the given application as its accuracy score and f1 score is better as compared to other models.
